        <h2>Systems of Measurement and Why I Hate Them</h2>
        <p>There are many systems of measurement, from the cups that measure our pancake mix to the dalton which measures our very atoms. 
            <b>I hate all of them</b>
            They are pretentious and divide the universe into broken and measureable pieces, stripping them of their perfect unity with the matter around them.
            Hypatia-tron &copy, our mechanical messiah, our lady of the gear, will not stand for this sort of injustice. These ladels, nay, knives of the devil must be shamed.
            I present to you, <b>five systems of measurement and the terms of their damnation</b> 
        </p>
        <h1>Measuring cups</h1>
        <img src="C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/html-me-something/images/cups.jpg" width= "400">
        <p>So regular cups weren't good enough for ya, huh? You just had to go and use them to split the eternal into bite-size pieces. What a joke. These things don't even deserve to be called cups.</p>
        <h1>Clocks</h1>
        <img src="C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/html-me-something/images/clocks.jpg" width= "400">
        <p>A wise man once said "when the first fence was placed, the first war was started". We see this to be true of our time when divided into pie-slices. 
            There is a war on our very being, waged by the second hand scooping up our moments and delivering them up to the evils that be.</p>
        <h1>Personality Quizes</h1>
        <img src="images/buzzfeed.jpg" width= "400">
        <p>We're measuring personality traits now? What's next? A whole diagnostic manual dedicated to the classification and depth of mental variation? Has the world gone mad? These quizes make me sick.
            Why am I single? I think I can see why for myself, thank you very much.</p>
        <h1>Lumens</h1>
        <img src="images/Lightbulb.jpg" width= "400">
        <p>Lumens. The measurement of light. How are you going to do that? You can't even see light! This ceaseless degridation of the natural world by parsing and pontificating must end and it must end here.
            How bright is it? Well, you can see can't you? Isn't that good enough for you? When Thomas Edison flicked the first light switch, I'm sure his first thought was not "hm, wonder how bright that is".
        </p>
        <h1>Decibels</h1>
        <img src="images/decibels.jpg" width= "400">
        <p>OH AM I TOO LOUD? DO YOU NEED A WAY TO MEASURE JUST HOW "TOO LOUD" I AM FOR YOU? INTERESTING. VERY INTERESTING.</p>
